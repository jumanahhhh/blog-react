This is my story. I wanted to\n//           do masters after my college and had dreams of making it big, but life\n//           had some other plans for me. My parents got a very promising match for\n//           me and wanted me to get married and settle down in life when I was\n//           barely 19 years young.<br/><br/> Everything happened so quickly that before even\n//           my final exams started I was hooked. Suddenly my whole life took a 360\n//           degree turn. Born and brought up in Hyderabad now after marriage I\n//           landed in Chennai. New place, new people, new language, I was\n//           completely lost for the first couple of years. My dreams of making it\n//           big become far from reality. Blessed with a daughter and a son my life\n//           revolved around my kids, husband, family, friends and relatives. I had\n//           everything in my life what I had desired for, but still was always\n//           feeling empty and hollow from inside. My cup was always half full. <br/><br/> In\n//           between all this I never realised when I stopped dreaming for myself,\n//           my ambitions, my success. Reality hit me when my children became\n//           independent and didn’t need me anymore to take care of them, their\n//           studies and classes. I became depressed & lonely, I didn’t know what\n//           kind of conversations to have with them, how to guide them for their\n//           further studies or their passions. I wanted my kids to look up to me\n//           as their role model, their idol, not just as their mumma. But the\n//           question was HOW? <br/><br/> But as they say “where there is a will there is a\n//           way”! I was desperate to live for myself again, dream for myself\n//           again, be financially independent. So the next thing I did was to get\n//           certified as a Life Coach and an Image Consultant. Today I am living\n//           the life of my dreams by helping women like me redesign their lives by\n//           discovering their true potential, helping them believing in themselves\n//           and their abilities. Life is all about choices you make, you have a\n//           choice to change your life”s story. To change your future you need to\n//           make a choice today. I am proud that I made a right choice that\n//           changed my whole life’s story. You have the power to own your life\n//           back. Do whatever it takes for you to do that, need help then don’t\n//           hesitate to ask, get a mentor who can guide you.
