            Hi, I am Tanuja Devang, <br />
            <br />
            You know when we have dreams, desires, plans, and aspirations to
            become successful in life and make a name for yourself, create your
            own identity in this world, be financially independent, thatâ€™s when
            LIFE HAPPENS. This is my story. I wanted to do a master's after my
            college and had dreams of making it big, but life had other plans
            for me. My parents got a very promising match for me and wanted me
            to get married and settle down in life when I was barely 19 years
            young.
            <br />
            <br />
            Everything happened so quickly that before even my final exams
            started I was hooked. Suddenly my whole life took a 360-degree turn.
            Born and brought up in Hyderabad, now after marriage, I landed in
            Chennai. New place, new people, new language, I was completely lost
            for the first couple of years. My dreams of making it big became
            far from reality. Blessed with a daughter and a son, my life
            revolved around my kids, husband, family, friends, and relatives. I
            had everything in my life that I had desired, but still always felt
            empty and hollow from the inside. My cup was always half full.
